# Machine Learning model for reddit to bolster Financial Institutions

**Financial Institutions** thrive on mass market consumption and interest rates. However they are **vulverable** to the economic cycle when **recession** hits. How bad a recession is based on the main cause -- consumers. Such as the 2007 financial crisis when a large amount of people defaulted on their loans due to their lack of knowledge of how money works.

Thankfully, there is a solution. As many people seek advice online due to it's convenience, an example being **reddit** subforums. As most posts are for the general audience, how much of this information is **relevant** to an individual?

This is where we've build our **Machine Learning model** to predict the main terms of subreddits to identify what kind of content dwells within. With similar subreddits such as r/Stocks and r/PovertyFinance which both give financial advice, our model helps guide people to access the right subreddit based on their financial situation.

For people requiring loan and debt solutions, r/PovertyFinance is for them and for those looking to place excess funds to support the economy, r/Stocks is the right place. When they are able to properly manage their funds, the **risks** of a terrible recession bubble with excess loan defaults and overvalued stocks will be **reduced**. Which directly in turn, **benefits financial institutions**.

Our model was able to have a **96% accuracy** on a large dataset of **1,500+ posts**, this will definitly continue to improve and become even more complex and flexible, spreading it's influence on other subreddits.

Inside our notebook, we've detailed the steps on how this is done as well as rooms for recommendations and improvements for the model, to help both the community and corporations.
